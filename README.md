# Pair game

Pair game. Find two identical animals. Do it as fast as you can and set records.

My intermediate work for the **"JavaScript. Base level"** Skillbox course.

Record is minimal time spent to open all cards. If the time record is the same, then the performance is compared by effectiveness. Good luck!
